relicalc is [Ranger](https://github.com/corvimae/pokemon-ranger)'s Pok√©mon math calculation code as a standalone Node (12+) library. It has all the math-y stuff from Ranger without any of that pesky UI nonsense, including:

- Calculating possible damage rolls for a move across all possible IVs.
- Determining possible IVs given the value of a stat at previous levels.
- Calculating experience gained from an encounter.
- Determining possible Hidden Power base damage and type based on possible IVs.
- Building combined type defensive typing tables.

...for all generations including Let's Go<sup>[1](#f1)</sup>.
